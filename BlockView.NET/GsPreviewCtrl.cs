//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// by Fenton Webb, DevTech, Autodesk. 23/05/2008

/// Revised by Tony Tanzillo, 10/2012, to correct issues that
/// prevented design-time instantiation of this control. Note
/// that there are no claims of ownership or warrantee of any
/// kind on this revised code, and the original owner retains 
/// all rights to same. Terms of use are subject to the terms
/// of the original publisher of the work.
/// 
/// See the OnSizeChanged() method for a brief discussion and
/// explaination of why design-time failures occur when AutoCAD
/// APIs and types are used in designable components, and how 
/// to avoid or correct that problem.
/// 
/// The basic refactoring pattern for avoiding design-time
/// failures resulting from use of AutoCAD types in methods
/// that execute in the designer is:
/// 
/// For any given method (represented as "MyMethod" in the
/// following example) that executes in the designer, the 
/// method is refactored thusly:
/// 
/// Before refactoring:
/// 
/// void MyMethod()
/// {
///    SomeOtherMethod();   // non-AutoCAD API call
///    
///    AutoCADMethod();     // A call to some AutoCAD API
/// }                       // that will likely cause a                      
///                         // a failure in the designer
///                         
/// The above after refactoring:
/// 
/// void MyMethod()
/// {
///    SomeOtherMethod(); // not an AutoCAD API call so it can stay here
///    
///	if( ! Utils.IsDesignMode )   // code that uses AutoCAD types
///	   InternalMyMethod();       // is refactored out to another
/// }                              // new method, and called from here
///                                // when not running in the designer
///                              
/// A new method is added, which encapsulates and isolates
/// the use of all AutoCAD types, and is called conditionally
/// from the method which the code was removed from, only when
/// not running in the designer:
/// 
/// void InternalMyMethod()
/// {
///    AutoCADMethod();
/// }
/// 
/// If you are wondering why it is necessary to refactor the
/// code into two methods, as opposed to simply guarding the
/// code that uses AutoCAD types with a relatively-simpler 
/// 'if( ! Utils.IsDesignMode ) {...}' test, the reason is 
/// because it is the jit'ing of the method itself that is 
/// causing the failure, which happens long before there is 
/// any use of AutoCAD types in the method.
///
/// Additional fixes and changes:
/// 
/// 1. The base type is Control rather than Panel. There is no
///    need to derive from a Panel for a control of this type.
///    
/// 2. GsPreviewCtrl.Designer.cs was removed as it serves no
///    purpose (the control does not need to be designable).
///
/// 3. In the included BlockViewDialog.cs and its .Designer.cs
///    file, the ToolStripMenuItems for selecting the RenderMode
///    and View Style were deleted, and are now created dynamically
///    at runtime (see EnumToolStripMenuItem.cs). This allowed the
///    elimination of vast amounts of code in BlockViewDialog.cs,
///    which did little other than handle each menu item's click
///    event, and check/uncheck related menu items.
